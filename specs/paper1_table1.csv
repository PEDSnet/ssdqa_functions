Cohort Fitness,Patient-Facts,Completeness,The completeness-focused checks in this module assess the availability of patient clinical data. The number of clinical events per year of follow-up for each patient in a cohort is computed and stratified by visit type. ,Tested & Validated
Variable Testing,Expected Variables Present,Completeness,This module both checks for the presence of checks and provides distributions of variables in a dataset. It allows the investigator to visualize multiple variables for comparison and to show the co-occurrence of variables in the same patient. ,Tested & Validated
Concept-Set Testing,Concept-Set Distribution,Information Representation,"This module provides distributions of concepts that form or represent a particular variable in a dataset. The purpose is to understand how the concept-sets drive the prevalence or clinical composition of variables for a particular study. For example, to identify asthma in a primary care cohort, wheezing or uncomplicated asthma may be the most common concept represented, but concepts related to asthma exacerbation or severe asthma may be most common in a more specialized respiratory cohort. ",Tested & Validated
Concept-Set Testing,Source and Concept Vocabularies,Information Representation,"The checks in this module demonstrate how source system concept mappings impact the representation of concepts in the data. It aims to provide researchers with source-to-concept mappings and their distributions to identify problems or issues with how standardization may result in information loss. To run these checks, the source code as well as the represented code must be available. ",Tested & Validated
Cohort Fitness,Patient Event Sequencing,Plausibility,"This module evaluates the plausibility of dates in relationship to clinical events. For example, a diagnosis for chronic kidney disease should precede a procedure order for dialysis. If events are not sequenced in the expected order, it may indicate inappropriate documentation or a patient receiving the majority of their care at a different institution. ",Tested & Validated
Dataset Fitness,Clinical Events and Specialty Agreement,Concordance,"The concordance-focused checks in this module assess the quality of specialty data in a study sample. The goal is to evaluate the concordance of specific events (e.g., diagnosis of type I diabetes) and specialist providers or care sites (e.g., endocrinologist or endocrinology clinic) at the visit level. ",Tested & Validated
Cohort Identification,Attrition Step,Plausibility,These checks will assess each step of attrition criteria to identify anomalies in cohort construction. ,Tested & Validated
Data Conformance,Clinical Metadata,Conformance,"The checks in this module assess whether clinical facts are accompanied by appropriate metadata. Examples of metadata-clinical fact pairings identified include the proportion of prescription drugs and dosing information, lab values and an assigned specimen, or anthropometric measures and an appropriate unit. ",Specified & In Queue
Data Conformance,Unit & Value Alignment,Concordance,This module determines whether drug prescriptions/administrations or lab results contain units that are plausible. This module checks for conformance of the result and unit values. The Quantitative Variable Distributions checks for plausibility of result values assuming the units are correct.  ,Specified & In Queue
Data Conformance,Duplicate Record Check,Conformance,The checks in this module identify where there are duplicate rows or values in a given dataset. ,Specified & In Queue
Concept-Set Testing,Unmapped Concepts,Information Representation,"This module computes proportions of unmapped concepts within a dataset. It is intended to provide information about missing concepts that the investigator should account for. To run this module, missing variables should not be removed from the dataset.",Active Development
Variable Testing,Quantitative Variable Distributions,Plausibility,"The checks in this module allow the user to evaluate quantitative distributions of clinical values (e.g., lab values, BMI, etc.) or patient characteristics (e.g., number of visits per patient, follow-up time) in a clinical dataset.",Specified & In Queue
Dataset Fitness,Visit Clinical Data Agreement,Concordance,"This module tests whether expected clinical events occur within the same clinical encounter or visit. For example, ventilator support should occur in an intensive or critical care unit, or a prescription for an antihypertensive medication should be accompanied with a blood pressure reading. The investigator provides information about the expected clinical events, and the modules compute comparisons, distributions, and identifies anomalies. ",Specified & In Queue
Dataset Fitness,Date Sequencing,Plausibility,"This module provides a set of checks to ensure that the dates within a dataset are plausible. It detects outliers and anomalous values such as dates too far in the past or future, but also whether dates assigned to clinical events occurring within the same visit are plausible. ",Specified & In Queue
Cohort Fitness,Patient Record Consistency,Concordance,"This module tests whether the clinical data in a patient?s record is consistent. For example, the records of patients receiving highly specialized care should be confirmatory and complete (e.g., patients with leukemia should be receiving chemotherapy). This module is at the patient-level rather than at the visit-level. The Visit Clinical Data Agreement module can augment this module to determine whether expected events also occur within the same visit. ",Active Development
Cohort Fitness,Expected Facts Present,Completeness,"The checks in this module evaluate whether a cohort possesses specific types of clinical data, such as BMI, office visit procedures, or vital signs.",Specified & In Queue
Cohort Fitness,Clinical Data Values and Ranges,Plausibility,The checks in this module assess whether clinical data outcomes or values align with patient cohort characteristics. ,Specified & In Queue
Cohort Identification,Sensitivity to Selection Criteria,Plausibility,"These checks test the differences in demographics, follow-up time, and utilization patterns when alternative cohort definitions are used. ",Active Development
