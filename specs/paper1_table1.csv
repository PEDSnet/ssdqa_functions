Cohort Fitness,Patient-Facts,pf,The completeness-focused checks in this module assess the availability of patient clinical data. The number of clinical events per year of follow-up for each patient in a cohort is computed and stratified by visit type. 
Variable Testing,Expected Variables Present,evp,This module both checks for the presence of checks and provides distributions of variables in a dataset. It allows the investigator to visualize multiple variables for comparison and to show the co-occurrence of variables in the same patient. 
Concept-Set Testing,Concept-Set Distribution,csd,"This module provides distributions of concepts that form or represent a particular variable in a dataset. The purpose is to understand how the concept-sets drive the prevalence or clinical composition of variables for a particular study. For example, to identify “asthma” in a primary care cohort, wheezing or uncomplicated asthma may be the most common concept represented, but concepts related to asthma exacerbation or severe asthma may be most common in a more specialized respiratory cohort. "
Concept-Set Testing,Source and Concept Vocabularies,scv,"The checks in this module demonstrate how source system concept mappings impact the representation of concepts in the data. It aims to provide researchers with source-to-concept mappings and their distributions to identify problems or issues with how standardization may result in information loss. To run these checks, the source code as well as the represented code must be available. "
Cohort Fitness,Patient Event Sequencing,pes,"This module evaluates the plausibility of dates in relationship to clinical events. For example, a diagnosis for chronic kidney disease should precede a procedure order for dialysis. If events are not sequenced in the expected order, it may indicate inappropriate documentation or a patient receiving the majority of their care at a different institution. "
Dataset Fitness,Clinical Events and Specialty Agreement,cnc_sp,"The concordance-focused checks in this module assess the quality of specialty data in a study sample. The goal is to evaluate the concordance of specific events (e.g., diagnosis of type I diabetes) and specialist providers or care sites (e.g., endocrinologist or endocrinology clinic) at the visit level. "
Cohort Identification,Attrition Step,ca,These checks will assess each step of attrition criteria to identify anomalies in cohort construction.
